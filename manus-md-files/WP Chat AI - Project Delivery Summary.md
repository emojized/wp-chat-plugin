## Key Features Implemented

### AI-Powered Question Answering
- **Naive Bayes Algorithm**: Probabilistic classifier that analyzes user questions and matches them with relevant content
- **Content Tokenization**: Intelligent text processing that breaks down posts into meaningful tokens
- **Confidence Scoring**: Each response includes a confidence level to indicate reliability
- **Source Attribution**: Responses include links back to the original content

### Modern Chat Interface
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- **Multiple Positions**: Chat widget can be positioned in any corner of the screen
- **Real-time Communication**: Instant responses using AJAX
- **Message History**: Persistent chat history using browser local storage
- **Typing Indicators**: Visual feedback during processing
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error messages and recovery

### Comprehensive Admin Dashboard
- **Settings Management**: Full control over chat appearance and behavior
- **Training Interface**: Real-time model training with progress monitoring
- **Analytics**: Chat logs with interaction tracking and confidence metrics
- **Status Monitoring**: System health and performance indicators

### Security and Performance
- **Nonce Verification**: All AJAX requests include security tokens
- **Input Sanitization**: Proper sanitization of all user inputs
- **Capability Checks**: Admin functions restricted to appropriate user roles
- **Optimized Queries**: Efficient database operations
- **Caching Support**: Compatible with popular caching plugins

## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema
The plugin creates four custom tables:

1. **Training Data Table**: Stores processed post content and tokens
2. **Vocabulary Table**: Maintains word frequencies and document frequencies
3. **Model Data Table**: Stores calculated probabilities for the Naive Bayes model
4. **Chat Logs Table**: Records all user interactions for analytics

### Algorithm Implementation
The Naive Bayes implementation includes:

- **Training Phase**: Processes all published content to build the model
- **Prediction Phase**: Analyzes user queries and returns best matches
- **Probability Calculation**: Uses Bayes' theorem with Laplace smoothing
- **Confidence Scoring**: Relative confidence based on score differences

### Frontend Architecture
- **Modular JavaScript**: Object-oriented approach with clear separation of concerns
- **Event-Driven Design**: Responsive to user interactions and system events
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works with JavaScript disabled (graceful degradation)
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliant with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

## Installation and Usage

### Quick Start
1. Upload the `wp-chat-ai-plugin.zip` file to WordPress
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu
3. Go to **WP Chat AI > Settings** to configure the chat interface
4. Navigate to **WP Chat AI > Training** and click "Start Training"
5. Once training is complete, the chat interface will appear on your website

### Configuration Options
- **Chat Position**: Bottom-right, bottom-left, top-right, or top-left
- **Appearance**: Customizable title, placeholder text, and button text
- **Behavior**: Adjustable confidence threshold and response length limits
- **Training**: Manual or automatic model retraining

### Content Requirements
- Minimum 10 published posts for effective training
- Text-based content (the algorithm processes textual content)
- Diverse topics improve response quality and coverage
